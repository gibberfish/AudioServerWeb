Must have the DLL in the C:\Jacob folder and the folder in the PATH
Must have the jacob.dll in the lib folder of the tomcat installation
Must have the tomcat service running under the main user, not the system user (so that the app can see the media library)
Ensure that the tomcat exe files are set to run as Administrator in the compatibility mode tab (so you don't get an error on startup)
